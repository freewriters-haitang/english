_Attorneys in China claim between 30 and 50 writers have been arrested this year for writing gay erotica._

Dozens of writers have been arrested in China this year for publishing gay erotica online as law enforcement's crackdown on pornography increasingly targets [LGBTQ+ stories](https://www.pride.com/lgbtq/?utm_campaign=SmartLinks).

Police have arrested as many as 50 writers in Gansu in the past several weeks, according to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/28/world/asia/china-boys-love-women.html), which spoke with two lawyers representing detained authors who said they knew of at least six other cases. Other attorneys told the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c056nle2drno) that at least 30 writers, nearly all of them women in their 20s, have been arrested across the country since February.

Many of the writers were arrested after publishing on the Taiwan-based adult fiction website Haitang Literature, which allows authors to earn money through tips and subscriptions. One of the most popular genres on the website is "danmei" — romantic and sexual relationships between men.

Some of the writers have come forward about their arrests on the [social media platform](https://www.advocate.com/news/what-is-rednote-tiktok-alternate) Weibo only to be censored or taken down. One woman wrote, as first reported by the BBC, "I'll never forget it — being escorted to the car in full view, enduring the humiliation of stripping naked for examination in front of strangers, putting on a vest for photos, sitting in the chair, shaking with fear, my heart pounding."

The production and distribution of pornographic materials is illegal in China based on a [1997 law](http://www.npc.gov.cn/zgrdw/englishnpc/Law/2007-12/13/content_1384075.htm) that defines obscene material as “publications, films, video and audio recordings, and images containing depictions of sexual acts." Writers who make more than 250,000 yuan ($34,500) from selling erotic materials face a maximum sentence of life in prison.

The law, which applies even to writers making little or no money off their work, has not been consistently enforced. It has been [used to shut down](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1661) not just other fanfiction and erotica websites — with those running the platforms receiving sentences of up to 12 years in prison — but also to [prosecute](http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2002-10-25/0644781928.html) individuals consuming pornography in the privacy of their homes.

More than [50 writers were detained](https://www.advocate.com/world/china-writers-arrested-fanfiction-gay-erotica) in the province of Anhui from June to January by a “special task force” assigned with targeting online distributors of erotic fiction. Some of the top authors on Haitang Literature received varying sentences of one to five years in prison, differences being based on whether or not the writers were able to pay back the money they earned.

"If I could go back, I'd still choose to write. And I will keep writing," another writer said on Weibo. "Right now, I can only hope the law will see beyond the words on the page - and see the girl who skipped meals to save money, the girl who sold her hair to buy a pen, the girl who believed her mind could carve a way through fate. I hope it gives all of us a fair chance."
