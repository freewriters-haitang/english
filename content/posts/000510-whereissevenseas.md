### A Call for Seven Seas to support the LGBT+ creators they profit from.

LGBT+ danmei and baihe creators are being legally prosecuted in China as we speak due to anti-queer crackdowns, being psychologically tormented in detainment and given up to 10 years prison-time for the "crime" of writing queer stories.

Seven Seas Entertainment is the leading publisher & translator of danmei in the States and has been conspicuously silent. This silence sets a dangerous precedent of abandoning the most vulnerable communities when they most need support and transparency, all while still profiting off the popularity of their work.

Since the company’s inception in 2004, Jason DeAngelis and Seven Seas Entertainment have prided themselves on being independent, forward-thinking publishers who see quality in overlooked and undervalued mediums. Seven Seas has published and profited from nearly 100 danmei titles, all while staying silent about the persecution of danmei creators. Now is the time to stand with the creatives who’ve made Seven Seas’ success possible.

#### Five Demands to Seven Seas Entertainment

We call on Seven Seas Entertainment to take immediate action to support their Chinese collaborators.

(1) Release a public statement on the Seven Seas website as well as all social media platforms acknowledging the persecution of danmei and baihe writers to their sizable follower-base

(2) Release a public statement, as a leading publisher of danmei, re-affirming the artistic and cultural merit of the danmei genre and rejecting the queer-phobic notion that danmei is inherently and always “obscene”

(3) Transparency with the public and potential collaborators about the profits earned from danmei and baihe titles

(4) Transparency with the public and potential collaborators about the net earnings going to Chinese creators and translators

(5) Provide fair and reasonable compensation & productivity standards to Chinese translators in line with United Workers of Seven Seas work standards
