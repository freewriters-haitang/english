I am going to Lanzhou next week, feeling desperate.

I finally gained a few readers who like me after starting writing by myself. When I was happy about meeting those loving readers and friends, what they tipped me became the ironclad evidence of my profiteering.

I just passed the postgraduate entrance examination this year, found a temporary job, and made an appointment with friends to go out for a trip and wait for the start of school in September. Everything was too good to be true.

However, a phone call from Lanzhou, Gansu completely shattered my sweet dream. They said that I won’t be able to study for a master's degree, and I lost my temporary job. I also stammered and turned down the travel appointment with my friends.

All the profits were just a little over 2,000 yuan, the round-trip air tickets to Lanzhou spent them all. I wrote two books with a total of more than 200,000 words, and the number of clicks was cumulative calculated to be more than 100,000.

My first reaction was absurd.

Online novels have a holistic quality, but they treat each chapter as an independent work and accumulate the number of clicks for each chapter. (There are 72 chapters in the two books, and the highest number of clicks for the free first chapter is only 5,000)

Who can guarantee that 5,000 people have read the whole book?

Who can confirm that there are no repeated clicks among the 100,000 clicks?

What exactly is actual click and effective click?

There is a fundamental difference between one IP clicking 72 times and 72 IP clicking once, but they convicted me in the most crude and rough way.

They did not do deduplication, turned a deaf ear to my protests, and did not record my words in full in the transcript.

Are my clicks really that high? Are there really 100,000 people who have seen them as they said? Do they really want to sentence me to three to five years? Don’t they know how precious three to five years of life are?

Have written this, I feel more that it is unfair.

I checked the legal terms overnight. They forcibly confiscated my phone without a search warrant, checked my privacy records, flipped through my photo albums, peeked at my chat records, and even asked me to tell them my Alipay password and WeChat password.

Why should I be like this, as if I were stripped naked and stared at?

I stayed in there for almost twelve hours after the first transcript was completed.

My dad had been waiting for me outside the police station. He asked them carefully what I had done wrong, and said in a low voice that I was still young and didn't know what I was doing, it was really not intentional.

I had been enduring the pain, but couldn't help crying when I saw him.

I said sorry, sorry, sorry to my dad.

He held me in his arms, touched my head and said it was okay, it was okay, I'll talk to your mum when I get home, and you can talk to her after she calms down.

My dad used his phone, which he hadn't changed for several years, to pay the bill. The phone case had turned yellow, and the phone film had several obvious scratches on it.

I watched the wind at one o'clock in the morning blowing on his thin face, and his fingers were not very flexible in tapping the amount.

Tears kept falling, and they kept falling.
