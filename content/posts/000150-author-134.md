[Original Chinese Version](https://freewriters-haitang.github.io/posts/000150-author-134/)

On August 1 last year, around 3pm, my mother suddenly shouted my name loudly on the first floor, she kept shouting, asking me to come downstairs.

At that moment, I actually felt something was going wrong, because she has never shouted my name like that.

Her voice was very high and anxious.

I live in the countryside, in an old-fashioned four-story building. Because it is on the side of the road, our house is just next to our neighbors' houses, and there are several houses connected together like that.

My room is on the third floor. I still remember that day I was wearing a summer vest and shorts pajamas. While I asked her what was going on, I heard a lot of footsteps coming upstairs.

There are basically no guests coming to our house, and it is unlikely that so many people just came and wanted to go upstairs all in a sudden.

I actually thought of that possibility.

After all, I had seen the news about the authors in Haitang being arrested on the Internet before.I’m used to not wearing a bra at home. I didn't know how I managed to put it on in such a short time, and then immediately went downstairs.

I was halfway to the second floor when I saw a group of policemen. 

There were eight or nine of them. My mind went blank at that moment.

The stairs in my house are very narrow, and it seemed very cramped with so many people standing on it.

One of the uniformed policemen asked me if I was xxx. I said yes. A plainclothes policeman next to him took out his police ID and showed it to me quickly. He said he was from the Public Security Bureau of Jixi, Anhui. “Do you know why we came to you?”, he asked.

The local policemen were all in uniform, and the three plainclothes policemen were all from Jixi.

I was surrounded by the group of police in the utility room on the second floor of my house. The plainclothes policeman questioned me if I knew what I had done.

I am actually very weak in character, and I like to escape from reality. You may not understand what I’m saying, but even though I was already in the middle of it, at that moment my brain still felt that everything in front of me was fake.

I was so confused throughout the whole process, fear came over me slowly and belatedly. 

They said they would take me to the Public Security Bureau for questioning and asked me to change clothes.

A female police officer followed me upstairs with a recorder. I am from the south and don’t even have experience taking a bath in a bathhouse. I have rarely changed clothes in front of a strange woman. But that day I had to take off all my clothes in front of her.

I remember that I chose a short-sleeved shirt at first, the female police officer said kindly that the interrogation room was very cold, I would really feel cold in short sleeves.

So I changed into a long-sleeved shirt. After I changed, all the other policemen came in and took away my mobile phone and computer, then took me to the police car.

Two cars stopped on the road in front of our house, and eight or nine police officers took me outside... This scene made all the neighbors next to us come out to watch...

I got into the police car, two policemen sat left and right trapping me in the middle, and the recorder was placed on the armrest just in front of me.

Then the first thing one of the policemen asked me was, “How much money do you have in your savings?”

Funny, ridiculous, right?

I was actually still confused when I arrived at the Public Security Bureau in our city. Maybe it was to escape reality, my brain stopped working.

Didn't the Internet say that the off-site law enforcement requires a lot of documents? They have them all. Anyway, the local police cooperated with them and arranged an interrogation room for them.

There was a process for entering the interrogation room, physical examination (that is, entering a small room and being touched all over the body), taking photos of height and weight and the front and side (yes, like in TV dramas), recording all fingerprints and voiceprints, and then taking your blood sample.

The blood sample was taken by pricking your finger with a pin-like needle.

I am very afraid of pain. I have never dared to see the scene of injections since I was a child. At that time, when the needle pierced my finger, my suppressed emotions almost collapsed, but I still didn't dare to cry. I was afraid that they would scold me if I cried, so I tried my best to hold back tears.

It was not until the moment of being pricked by the needle that I accepted the reality. I was arrested now. At this moment in front of them, I lost my human rights.

When I was asked to sign later, my hands were shaking so much that I couldn't write. The police even smiled and said, "Don't be so scared."

But how can I not be?

I just remember my voice was shaking.

Then there was the interrogation that lasted more than seven hours.

The interrogation process left a deep shadow on me. I feel physically nauseous when I recall.

Although I was released on bail that day, I still developed PTSD afterwards. I couldn't hear the phone ringing, I didn't let my mother call me downstairs, I was terrified whenever there was a sound downstairs, and I would tremble with fear when I heard someone's footsteps coming upstairs.

I was so anxious that I found it hard to sleep or eat in peace for a long time. I couldn't sleep at night and went to the hospital to get sleeping pills. I only took them for two weeks out of fear of addiction, and started drinking liquor to sleep.

Thinking that I would be imprisoned for three to five years, I might as well die.

Coupled with the pressure of returning the illegal income was huge during that period, I had a lot of negative thoughts.

Although I have survived it now, when I recall all this, the pain still comes.

It wasn't until later that I met Mr. Krabs and we comforted each other that I slowly began to come to terms with it a little.

We have all encountered those interrogation “talks” like Mr. Krabs said, and there are even more disgusting ones, it’s just I’m forbidden to talk about them.

I remember the second interrogation, the police asked me, when you wrote those plots (sexual related parts), did you think about them all day?

In their minds, we who write these are perverts, and women who write these are even more perverted.

There was a document that identified our novels as obscene and pornographic. At that time, the police said that I had the right to re-evaluate, so I asked, what is the standard for this? Is it based on percentage or something else.

My readers should know that my novels don’t actually contain much sexual related parts. I have a novel of more than 400,000 words. If all the sexual related contents are deleted, it will only be about 20,000 words less.

I was just trying  to fight for myself and see if I could get the amount I was charged for a little less. But as a result, I was scolded by the police for more than half an hour just because I asked.

He asked if he had to bring my novel here and read it in front of me so that I could learn how pornographic I wrote?

He slammed the table, said that I had a bad attitude, and more.

I went through two interrogations, the first one lasted from 4pm to the early morning, and the second one lasted more than 4 hours. I didn't cry much during the first interrogation even though it lasted way longer, I am used to suppressing my emotions. But the second time I have been really broken down by that policeman many times, almost crying bitterly.

I have lived for more than 20 years, and I really never thought that I would encounter such things. I grew up in a poor family, I was reluctant to spend the money I earned, I lived a frugal life and worked hard to make money to change my life. As a result, I didn't save or get to spend those money, instead, I got hundreds of thousands in debt.

I have written so much, but I am not saying that I am not wrong. I made the wrong choice and took the wrong path, so I was punished.

The reason why I like ACGN and like to write novels is because that world is completely created by me. It is just the kind of world I like and want.

Reality is too cruel and too scary for me.

In fact, we tried to resist at the beginning, and many authors also hired lawyers who should be considered not bad.

It's useless. No matter how we debated(we tried to raise all the points mentioned on the Internet at that time that we could think of), as long as they didn't admit it, they can reject it completely.

After going through it, you will understand that it is useless. The struggle of ordinary people is the most powerless. They have the final say in everything.

Just like now, it seems that we are all over, but are we really over?
