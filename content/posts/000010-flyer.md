**You might have read Heaven Official’s Blessing (Tian Guan Ci Fu), Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation (Mo Dao Zu Shi), The Scum Villain's Self-Saving System, but did you know...**

**Mo Xiang Tong Xiu, the author of these beloved works, was jailed in 2018 for “illegal publication.” 
Since then, she has gone MIA until 2024, when she showed up on the internet with a censored version of Heaven Official’s Blessing.**

**Now, similar incidents are happening again—this time to more Chinese female young authors, with more cruelty. These college girls and young adults are facing police interrogation and brutality, And we need your attention.**

**Haitang Literature** is a Chinese-language website specializing in free and paid explicit yaoi fiction, where the majority of the writers are female. Since June 2024, many authors on the site have stopped updating and gone missing. These young women writers disappeared with no public awareness until the authors and their families revealed on the internet that over fifty authors were quietly detained by the Anhui provincial police. Some were even sent to prison without a fair trial. At this point the arrests were made under the pretense that it is illegal to “compose and spread obscene materials”.

On **June 1, 2025**, the second wave of hunting young female writers broke out. Authorities in China call it “**deep-sea fishing**”, a trans-regional policing campaign led by **Lanzhou Police**. This time, the crackdown extended to any writers on the **Haitang Literature** website. Profited from the writing or not,writing explicit content or not, they were summoned by police, and threatened with huge fines or jail time while in custody. Even those who had never published explicit material were humiliated by police for being “immoral”. At this point it is obvious that “obscene materials” is but an excuse to crack down on freedom of expression. The police even went after **readers** based on their payment records, using **reading histories and IP addresses** to identify the writers for further questioning. This is a blatant disregard of due process, and is a **grave violation of freedom of expression and personal privacy**.

This appalling news drew very limited attention on Chinese social media. Although **BBC China** and a few independent outlets reported on the issue, no in-depth investigations were conducted. Without public attention, the writers are facing the police power alone. 

Chinese writers deserve the freedom to express, create, and love. They deserve the freedom from censorship and oppression, and **the freedom from fear**.
