[Orignal Chinese Version](https://freewriters-haitang.github.io/posts/000230-p137/)

I’ve lived like an orphan for decades—gritting my teeth and getting through it all on my own, carrying a body full of pain and illness. But I’m still standing strong.

Just a few days ago, I joked with my bestie: maybe I should start preparing clothes for all four seasons—because if I really do end up in prison, you’ll be the only one bringing me something to wear.

I truly hope that day never comes. With the way my health is now, I doubt I’d survive even a month in there.

There are still so many people in the stories I care about, and I want to see their journeys come to a happy ending. Wish me luck—I hope mine ends with one too! 🙏🙏🙏
